# FIFA 19 Exploratory Player Data Analysis
This is my first project involving workning with Python, Matplotlib and pandas.
I take a big love of mine, FIFA 19, and make some small visualizations and analysis around the players from the game.

The analysis is made in Jupyter Notebook and is found in the "fifa19_PlayersAnalysis.ipynb" file
